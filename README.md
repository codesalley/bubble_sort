## How it works
Bubble Sort is an Array sorting algorithms. It is one of the simpler techniques, at the cost of being more processor-intensive.

In this algorithm, each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. The algorithm continues and repeates until the array is eventually sorted.
